mtbotter [WIP]
========

Currently after compiling it(see Minetest's manual about compiling),
and running `bin/minetest` a bot will connect to `127.0.0.1` on port
`30000` and will do below till you terminate it via CtrlC:

 - Sends a public chat message(only once)
 - Jumps
 - Goes forward and backward
